    <p>
        since Rancher2.x deny to list cluster by name if your token scope is single cluster.<br>
        <b>Note: ClusterId is NOT cluster name. </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        in Rancher2.x "Add API Key" dialog, please check carefully about "Scope" drop-down. <br>
        the ClusterId is in brackets after cluster name. <br>
        eg: mycluster ( c-h4hxd ), the ClusterId is <b>c-h4hxd</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        besides, you can find this id in browser address box when you click "Cluster" menu in Rancher2.x Web UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you omit this value, you must specify "clusterName" or "clusterId" in your build arguments.
