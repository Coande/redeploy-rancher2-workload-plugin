<div>
    you can find your workload API path in Rancher2.x web UI-->Cluster->Project->Resources->Workloads, <br>
    click the menu icon and select "View in API", will open in new browser tab. copy url to here. <br>
    since endpoint part has bean set in Credential, you only need specify path from "/project", eg: <br>
    /project/c-h4hxd:p-c9j8z/workloads/deployment:default:busybox
