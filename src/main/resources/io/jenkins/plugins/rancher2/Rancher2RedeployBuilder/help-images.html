    update image version to your excepted. optional if you use latest as image version or imagePullPolicy="Always"<br>
    you can use semicolon(;) to split multiple images, eg:
    <p>
        nginx;nginx:1.0;myteam/myproject:v2.0;docker.io/team/image:v1.0.${BUILD_NUMBER}
    </p>
    this plugin will update all images in this workload by <b>match the name part exactly</b>, and simply set version part as you specified.
    so you may need Jenkins variables to dynamic generate new version number.
